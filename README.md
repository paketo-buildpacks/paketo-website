Website for [Paketo Buildpacks](https://paketo.io)

## Development

### Prerequisites

* [Hugo (extended version)](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/)
* [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/configuring-your-local-environment)

### Navigating this repo
* HTML lives in [`layouts/`](/layouts), including [partials](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)
(HTML snippets) that are reused across multiple pages.
* SCSS and Javascript live in [`assets/`](/assets)
* Much of the CSS uses the [BEM naming methodology](https://en.bem.info/methodology/quick-start/). 
* Hugo automatically compiles our SCSS into CSS. This is a feature of Hugo extended version.

## Deployment
This repo uses a GHA workflow to automatically deploy commits on `main` to the [Paketo site](https://paketo.io) using GitHub Pages.

This repo uses a GHA workflow to automatically deploy commits on `develop` to the [permanent staging site](https://paketo-staging.web.app/). For large UX changes, consider opening your pull request against `develop` instead of `main` to allow more time to test the feature before deploying to prod.
