<h2>Signing the CLA</h2>
<p class="body">
In order to contribute code, you will need to sign the Contributor License Agreement. When opening a pull request to Paketo for the first time, the EasyCLA bot will add a comment to the PR indicating that the commit is <b>NOT COVERED</b> by a signed CLA.
<p class="body">
The authorization process will be slightly different depending on the type of contributor you are to the Paketo project:
</p>
<h3>Individual Contributor</h3>
If you are contributing code on your own behalf, instead of your employer or organization, please <a href="https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/easycla/v2-current/contributors/individual-contributor#github">follow these steps</a>
<h3>Corporate Contributor</h3>
If you are contributing code on behalf of your employer or other organization, please <a href="https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/easycla/v2-current/contributors/corporate-contributor#github">follow these steps</a>
<h4>Common questions about EasyCLA</h4>
<ul>
<li>Q: Which organization should I search for in the <b>Select Organization</b> field? </li>
<ul>
A: This is going to be the name of your employer
</ul>
<li>Q: What if my employer is not on the list?</li>
<ul>
A: You can add it yourself following <a href="https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/easycla/v2-current/contributors/corporate-contributor#if-your-company-is-not-in-the-list">these steps</a>
</ul>
<li>Q: I just sent the signing request but my PR is still blocked</li>
<ul>A: There are several things to confirm:</ul>
<ol>
<li>Has your employer already signed a CLA? If so, the CLA Manager in your organization will receive your signing request and will respond accordingly </li>
<li>If your employer has never signed the CLA (<b>No Signed CLA found</b>), please <a href="https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/easycla/v2-current/contributors/corporate-contributor#if-company-has-not-signed">follow these steps</a> depending on whether you or someone else in your org will become the CLA Manager</li>
