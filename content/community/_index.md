## How can I contribute to the project?

Welcome! We're glad you have an interest in improving Paketo Buildpacks.
Firstly, check out our [Contribution
Guide](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for an idea of where to start. We also have a collection of [good first
issues](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Apaketo-buildpacks+org%3Apaketo-community+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+state%3Aopen&type=Issues)
on our repositories if you're eager to start contributing.

### RFCs

If you'd like to learn more about the buildpacks architecture and the design
decisions being made, it may be helpful to read through some of our
[project-wide RFCs](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/rfcs). Some language
family buildpack repositories (e.g.
[Node.js](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/nodejs/tree/main/rfcs)) also
contain language-specific RFCs that may provide helpful context.

### Discussions

Do you have ideas for the future of the project? Well, we'd certainly like to
hear them! Check out our [Discussions
portal](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/feedback/discussions) to weigh in
on ongoing conversations or to start a new one.

  meetings](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/community#working-group-meetings)
