This documentation explains how to use the [Paketo Node.js Buildpack](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/nodejs)
to build applications for several common use-cases. For more in-depth
description of the buildpack's behavior and configuration see the Node.js
Buildpack Reference [documentation](/docs/reference/nodejs-reference).

## Build a Sample App
To build a sample app locally with this buildpack using the pack CLI, run

{{< code/copyable >}}
git clone https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/samples
cd samples/nodejs/npm
pack build my-app --buildpack gcr.io/paketo-buildpacks/nodejs \
  --builder paketobuildpacks/builder:base
{{< /code/copyable >}}

See [samples](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/samples/tree/main/nodejs/npm)
for how to run the app.

**NOTE: Though the example above uses the Paketo Base builder, this buildpack is
also compatible with the Paketo Full builder. The Paketo Full builder is
required if your app utilizes common C libraries.**

## Install a Specific Node Engine Version
The Node.js buildpack allows you to specify a version of Node.js to use during
deployment. This version can be specified in a number of ways, including
through the `BP_NODE_VERSION` environment variable, a `package.json`, `.nvmrc` or `.node-version` files. When specifying a
version of the Node.js engine, you must choose a version that is available
within the buildpack. The supported versions can be found on the Paketo Node Engine
component buildpack's [releases page](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/node-engine/releases/latest).

The buildpack prioritizes the versions specified in
each possible configuration location with the following precedence, from
highest to lowest: `BP_NODE_VERSION`, `package.json`, `.nvmrc` and `.node-version`.

### Using BP_NODE_VERSION

To configure the buildpack to use Node.js v12.12.0 when deploying your app, set the
following environment variable at build time, either directly (ex. `pack build
my-app --env BP_NODE_VERSION=12.12.0`) or through a
[project.toml](https://github.com/buildpacks/spec/blob/main/extensions/project-descriptor.md)
file:

{{< code/copyable >}}
BP_NODE_VERSION="12.12.0"
{{< /code/copyable >}}

### Using package.json
If your apps use `npm` or `yarn`, you can specify the Node.js version your apps use
during deployment by configuring the `engines` field in the `package.json`
file. To configure the buildpack to use Node.js v12.12.0 when deploying your
app, include the values below in your `package.json` file:

{{< code/copyable >}}
{
  "engines": {
    "node": "12.12.0"
  }
}
{{< /code/copyable >}}

For more information about the `engines` configuration option in the
`package.json` file, see the
[engines](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#engines) section of the
_npm-package.json_ topic in the NPM documentation.

### Using .nvmrc
Node Version Manager is a common option for managing the Node.js version an app
uses. To specify the Node.js version your apps use during deployment, include a
`.nvmrc` file with the version number. For more information about the contents
of a `.nvmrc` file, see [.nvmrc](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#nvmrc) in the
Node Version Manager repository on GitHub.

### Using .node-version
`.node-version` is another common option that is compatible with Node.js version managers
such as `asdf` and `nodenv`. You can use a `.node-version` file to set the Node.js version
that your apps use during deployment, according to one of the following formats:

{{< code/copyable >}}
12.12.0
{{< /code/copyable >}}

OR

{{< code/copyable >}}
v12.12.0
{{< /code/copyable >}}

OR

{{< code/copyable >}}
12.12
{{< /code/copyable >}}


### Deprecated: Using buildpack.yml

Specifying the Node version through `buildpack.yml` configuration will be deprecated in Node Engine Buildpack v1.0.0.
To migrate from using `buildpack.yml` please set the `$BP_NODE_VERSION` environment variable.

## Enable Heap Memory Optimization
Node.js limits the total size of all objects on the heap. Enabling the
`optimize-memory` feature sets this value to three-quarters of the total memory
available in the container. For example, if your app is limited to 1&nbsp;GB
at run time, the heap of your Node.js app is limited to 768&nbsp;MB.

You can enable memory optimization through the `BP_NODE_OPTIMIZE_MEMORY` environment variable.

### Using `BP_NODE_OPTIMIZE_MEMORY` Environment Variable
To enable memory optimization through the `BP_NODE_OPTIMIZE_MEMORY` environment
variable, set it to `true`.

{{< code/copyable >}}
pack build my-app \
  --buildpack gcr.io/paketo-buildpacks/nodejs \
  --env BP_NODE_OPTIMIZE_MEMORY=true
{{< /code/copyable >}}

### Deprecated: Using buildpack.yml

Enabling memory optimization through your `buildpack.yml` file will be
deprecated in Node Engine Buildpack v1.0.0. To migrate from using
`buildpack.yml` please set the `BP_NODE_OPTIMIZE_MEMORY` environment variable
mentioned above.

## Build an App From Source in a Subdirectory

To specify a subdirectory to be used as the root of the app, please use the
`BP_NODE_PROJECT_PATH` environment variable at build time either directly or
through a [`project.toml`](https://buildpacks.io/docs/app-developer-guide/using-project-descriptor).
This could be useful if your app is a part of a monorepo.

For example, if your project has the following structure:
```
.
├── go-app
│   ├── go.mod
│   └── main.go
└── node-app
    ├── file.js
    ├── index.js
    └── package.json
```
you could then set the following at build time.
```
$BP_NODE_PROJECT_PATH=node-app
```

## Specifying Scripts to Run During Build Phase
To specify a script or series of scripts to run during build phase, please use the 
`BP_NODE_RUN_SCRIPTS` environment variable at build time either directly or through a 
[`project.toml`](https://buildpacks.io/docs/app-developer-guide/using-project-descriptor). This 
could be useful if your app uses a framework like Angular, React, or Vue where you need to run 
scripts to build your app into a production state.

For example, if your project's `package.json` has the following scripts:
```json
{
  "scripts": { 
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "lint": "eslint src/**/*.js src/**/*.jsx",
  }
}
```
and your environment variable was set:
```
$BP_NODE_RUN_SCRIPTS=lint,build
```
then the `lint` and then `build` scripts would be run via npm or yarn, during build phase. Note that the 
value for `BP_NODE_RUN_SCRIPTS` must be a comma separated list of script names.

## Build an App that Uses NPM
The Node.js buildpack can detect automatically if an app requires `npm`.

### Configure NPM During the Build
The Node.js buildpack respects native configuration options for NPM. If you would
like to learn more about NPM native configuration please check the NPM
Configuration [documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/config)
and the `.npmrc`
[documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/configuring-npm/npmrc).

## Build an App that Uses Yarn
The Node.js buildpack can detect automatically if an app requires `yarn`, by
checking for a `yarn.lock` file.

### Configure Yarn During the Build
The Node.js buildpack respects native configuration options for Yarn. If you would
like to learn more about Yarn configuration using `.yarnrc` please visit [the
Yarn documentation](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/yarnrc).

## Compile Native Extensions with `node-gyp`
If your app requires compilation of native extensions using `node-gyp`, the Node.js buildpack requires that
you use the Paketo Full Builder. This is because `node-gyp` requires `python` which is excluded from the
the Paketo Base Builder's stack, and the module may require other shared objects.

### With pack and a Command-Line Flag
When building with the pack CLI, specify the latest Paketo Full Builder at build time
with the `--builder` flag.

{{< code/copyable >}}
pack build my-app --builder paketobuildpacks/builder:full
{{< /code/copyable >}}

## Build an App Without Package Management

The Node.js buildpack supports building apps without `node_modules` or a `package.json`.
It will detect this type of app automatically, by looking for one of these four files in
the root of your application directory:
- `server.js`
- `app.js`
- `main.js`
- `index.js`

### Specify A Custom Entrypoint
If your app's entrypoint file is not one of the four files named above,
you can specify a different file name (or path) by setting the `BP_LAUNCHPOINT`
environment variable at build time.

#### Using BP_LAUNCHPOINT
`BP_LAUNCHPOINT` can be set as follows:


{{< code/copyable >}}
BP_LAUNCHPOINT="./src/launchpoint.js"
{{< /code/copyable >}}

The image produced by the build will run `node src/launchpoint.js`
as its start command.

## Install a Custom CA Certificate
Node.js Buildpack users can provide their own CA certificates and have them
included in the container root truststore at build-time and runtime by
following the instructions outlined in the [CA
Certificates](docs/reference/configuration/#ca-certificates)
section of our configuration docs.

## Override the Start Process Set by the Buildpack
Node.js Buildpack users can set custom start processes for their app image by
following the instructions in the
[Procfiles](https://paketo.io/docs/reference/configuration/#procfiles) section
of our configuration docs.

## Set Environment Variables for App Launch Time
Node.js Buildpack users can embed launch-time environment variables in their
app image by following the documentation for the [Environment Variables
Buildpack](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/environment-variables/blob/main/README.md).

## Add Custom Labels to the App Image
Node.js Buildpack users can add labels to their app image by following the
instructions in the [Applying Custom
Labels](/docs/reference/configuration/#applying-custom-labels)
section of our configuration docs.
