# Java Buildpack
The [Paketo Java Buildpack][java] allows users to create an image containing a JVM application from a precompiled artifact or directly from source.

The Java Buildpack is a [composite buildpack][composite buildpack] and each step in a build is handled by one of it's [components](#components). The following docs describe common build configurations. For a full set of configuration options and capabilities see the homepages for the component buildpacks.

{{< table_of_contents >}}

## About the Examples
All Java Buildpack examples will use the Paketo [sample applications][samples].

Examples assume that the root of this repository is the working directory:
{{< code/copyable >}}
git clone https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/samples
cd samples
{{< /code/copyable >}}

The [pack CLI][pack] is used throughout the examples. `pack` is just one of several Cloud Native Buildpack [platforms][platforms] than can execute builds with the Java Buildpacks. For example, Spring Boot developers may want to explore the [Spring Boot Maven Plugin][spring boot maven plugin] or [Spring Boot Gradle Plugin][spring boot gradle plugin] .

Examples assume that the [Paketo Base builder][base builder] is the default builder:
{{< code/copyable >}}
pack set-default-builder paketobuildpacks/builder:base
{{< /code/copyable >}}

All java example images should return `{"status":"UP"}` from the [actuator health endpoint][spring boot actuator endpoints].
{{< code/copyable >}}
docker run --rm --tty --publish 8080:8080 samples/java
curl -s http://localhost:8080/actuator/health | jq .
{{< /code/copyable >}}

## Building from Source
The Java Buildpack can build from source using any of the following build tools:
* [Gradle][gradle] - Support provided by the [Gradle Buildpack][bp/gradle]
* [Leiningen][leiningen] - Support provided by the [Leiningen Buildpack][bp/leiningen]
* [Maven][maven] - Support provided by the [Maven Buildpack][bp/maven]
* [SBT][sbt] - Support provided by the [SBT Buildpack][bp/sbt])
 
The correct build tool to use will be detected based on the contents of the application directory.
 
The build should produce one the of [supported artifact formats](#building-from-a-compiled-artifact). After building, the buildpack will replace provided application source code with the exploded archive. The build will proceed as described in [Building from a Compiled Artifact](#building-from-a-compiled-artifact).

**Example**: Building with Maven

The following command creates an image from source with `maven`.

{{< code/copyable >}}
pack build samples/java \
  --path java/maven
{{< /code/copyable >}}

### Configuring the Build Tool
**Note**: The following set of configuration options are not comprehensive, see the homepage for the relevant component buildpacks for a full-set of configuration options.

#### Selecting a Module or Artifact

For a given build `<TOOL>`, where `<TOOL>` is one of `MAVEN`, `GRADLE`, `LEIN` or `SBT`, the selected artifact can be configured with one of the following environment variable at build-time:
* `BP_<TOOL>_BUILT_MODULE`
    * *Defaults* to the root module.
    * Configures the module in a multi-module build from which the buildpack will select the application artifact.
    * *Example*: Given `BP_MAVEN_BUILT_MODULE=api`, Paketo Maven Buildpack will look for the application artifact with the file pattern `target/api/*.[jw]ar`.
* `BP_<TOOL>_BUILT_ARTIFACT`
    * Defaults to a tool-specific pattern (e.g. `target/*.[jw]ar` for Maven, `build/libs/*.[jw]ar` for gradle). See component buildpack homepage for details.
    * Configures the built application artifact path, using [Bash Pattern Matching][bash pattern matching].
    * Supercedes `BP_<TOOL>_BUILT_MODULE` if set to a non-default value.
    * *Example*: Given`BP_MAVEN_BUILT_ARTIFACT=out/api-*.jar`, the Paketo Maven Buildpack will select a file with name `out/api-1.0.0.jar`.

#### Specifying the Build Command

For a given build `<TOOL>`, where `<TOOL>` is one of `MAVEN`, `GRADLE`, `LEIN` or `SBT`, the build command can be configured with the following environment variable at build-time:
* `BP_<TOOL>_BUILD_ARGUMENTS`
    * *Defaults* to a tool-specific value (e.g. `-Dmaven.test.skip=true package` for Maven, `--no-daemon -x test build` for Gradle). See component buildpack homepage for details.
    * Configures the arguments to pass to the build tool.
    * *Example*: Given `BP_GRADLE_BUILD_ARGUMENTS=war`, the Paketo Gradle Buildpack will execute `./gradlew war` or `gradle war` (depending on the presence of the gradle wrapper).

#### Connecting to a Private Maven Repository

A [binding][bindings] with type `maven` and key `settings.xml` can be used to provide custom [Maven settings][maven settings].
```
<binding-name>
├── settings.xml
└── type
```

The value of `settings.xml` file may contain the credentials needed to connect to a private Maven repository.

**Example**: Providing Maven Settings

The following steps demonstrate how to use a `settings.xml` file from your workstation with `pack`.


1. Create a directory to contain the binding.
{{< code/copyable >}}
mkdir java/maven/binding
{{< /code/copyable >}}

2. Indicate that the binding is of type `maven` with a file called `type` inside the binding, containing the value `maven`.
{{< code/copyable >}}
echo -n "maven" > java/maven/binding/type
{{< /code/copyable >}}

3. Copy the `settings.xml` file from the workstation to the binding.
{{< code/copyable >}}
cp ~/.m2/settings.xml java/maven/binding/settings.xml
{{< /code/copyable >}}

4. Provide the binding to `pack build`.
{{< code/copyable >}}
pack build samples/java \
   --path java/maven \
   --volume $(pwd)/java/maven/binding:/platform/bindings/my-maven-settings
{{< /code/copyable >}}

## Building from a Compiled Artifact
An application developer may build an image from following archive formats:
* [Executable JAR][executable jar] - Support provided by the [Executable Jar Buildpack][bp/executable-jar]
* [WAR][war] - Support provided by the [Apache Tomcat Buildpack][bp/apache-tomcat]
* [Distribution ZIP][dist-zip] - Support provided by the [DistZip Buildpack][bp/dist-zip]
 
The Java Buildpack expects the application directory to contain the extracted contents of the archive (e.g. an exploded JAR). Most platforms will automatically extract any provided archives.

If a WAR is detect the Java Buildpack will install [Apache Tomcat][apache tomcat]. For exact set of supported Tomcat versions can be found in the Java Buildpack [releases notes][bp/java/releases]. For tomcat configuration options see the [Apache Tomcat Buildpack][bp/apache-tomcat].

The component buildpack for the provided artifact format will contribute a start command to the image.

*Note*: All three of the [Apache Tomcat Buildpack][bp/apache-tomcat], [Executable Jar Buildpack][bp/executable-jar], and [DistZip Buildpack][bp/dist-zip] may opt-in during detection. However, only one of these buildpacks will actually contribute to the final image. This happens because the artifact type may be unknown during detection, if for example a previous buildpack [compiles the artifact](#building-from-source).

**Example**: Building from an Executable JAR

The following command uses Maven to compile an executable JAR and then uses `pack` to build an image from the JAR.

{{< code/copyable >}}
cd java/maven
./mvnw package
pack build samples/java \
   --path /target/demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
{{< /code/copyable >}}

The resulting application image will be identical to that built in the Building with Maven example.

## About the JVM
The Java Buildpack uses the [BellSoft Liberica][liberica] implementations of the JRE and JDK. JVM installation is handled by the [BellSoft Liberica Buildpack][bp/bellsoft-liberica]. The JDK will be installed in the build container but only the JRE will be contributed to the application image.

See the [homepage][[bp/bellsoft-liberica]] for the Bellsoft Liberica Buildpackfor a full set of configuration options.

### The JVM Version
The Bellsoft Liberica Buildpack provides support for the latest patch release of all version lines supported at the time of buildpack release. The exact set of JDK/JRE versions support by a given buildpack version can be found in the Java Buildpack [release notes][bp/java/releases].

#### Inspecting the JVM Version
The exact JRE version that was contributed to a given image can be read from the Bill-of-Materials.

**Example** Inspecting the JRE Version

Given an image named `samples/java` built from one of examples above, the following command should print the exact version of the installed JRE.
{{< code/copyable >}}
pack inspect-image samples/app --bom | jq '.local[] | select(.name=="jre") | .metadata.version'
{{< /code/copyable >}}

#### Configuring the JVM Version
The following environment variable configures the JVM version at build-time.
* `BP_JVM_VERSION`
    * Defaults to the latest LTS version at the time of release.
    * Configures a specific JDK or JRE version.
    * *Example*: Given `BP_JVM_VERSION=8` or `BP_JVM_VERSION=8.*` the buildpack will install the latest patch releases of the Java 8 JDK and JRE.

### Runtime JVM Configuration
The Java Buildpack configures the JVM by setting `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` in the JVM environment.
 
#### Memory Calculator
The Java Buildpack installs a component called the Memory Calculator which will configure JVM memory based on the resources available to the container at runtime. The calculated flags will be appended to `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`.

#### Configuring JVM at Runtime
The runtime JVM can be configured in two ways:
1. Buildpack-provided runtime components including the Memory Calculator accept semantically named environment variables which are then used to derive `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` flags. Examples include: 
    * `BPL_JVM_HEAD_ROOM`
    * `BPL_JVM_LOADED_CLASS_COUNT`
    * `BPL_JVM_THREAD_COUNT`
2. Flags can be set directly at runtime with the `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` environment variable. User-provided flags will be appended to buildpack-provided flags. If the user and a buildpack set the same flag, user-provided flags take precedence.

See the [homepage][bp/bellsoft-liberica] for the Bellsoft Liberica Buildpack for a full set of configuration options.

## Spring Boot Applications
If the application uses Spring Boot the [Spring Boot Buildpack][bp/spring-boot] will enhance the resulting image by adding additional metadata to the image config,
applying Boot-specific performance optimizations, and enabling runtime auto-configuration.

### Additional Metadata
The Spring Boot Buildpack adds the following additional image labels:
   * `org.opencontainers.image.title` - set to the value of `Implementation-Title` from  `MANIFEST.MF`.
   * `org.opencontainers.image.version` - set to the values of `Implementation-Version` from `MANIFEST.MF`.
   * `org.springframework.boot.version` - set to the value of `Spring-Boot-Version` from `MANIFEST.MF`.
   * `org.springframework.cloud.dataflow.spring-configuration-metadata.json` - containing [configuration metadata][spring boot configuration metadata].
   * `org.springframework.cloud.dataflow.spring-configuration-metadata.json` - containing `dataflow-configuration-metadata.properties`, if present.

In addition, the buildpack will add an entry with name `dependencies` to the Bill-of-Materials listing the application dependencies.

**Example**: Inspecting Application Dependencies

The following command uses `pack` to list every dependency of a sample application.
{{< code/copyable >}}
pack inspect-image samples/java --bom | jq '.local[] | select(.name=="dependencies") | .metadata.dependencies[].name'
{{< /code/copyable >}}
  
### Runtime Auto-Configuration

The Spring Boot Buildpack adds [Spring Cloud Bindings][spring cloud bindings] to the application class path. Spring Cloud Bindings will auto-configure the application to connect to an external service when a binding of a supported type provides credentials and connection information at runtime. Runtime auto-configuration is enabled by default but can be disabled with the `BPL_SPRING_CLOUD_BINDINGS_ENABLED` environment variable.

### Optimizations

The Spring Boot Buildpack can apply domain-specific knowledge to optimize the performance of Spring Boot applications. For example, if the buildpack detects that the application is a reactive web application the thread count will be reduced to `50` from a default of `250`.

## Connecting to an APM
The Java Buildpack supports the following [APM][apm] integrations:
* [Azure Application Insights][azure application insights] - support provided by the [Azure Application Insights Buildpack][bp/azure-application-insights]
* [Google Stackdriver][google stackdriver] - support provided by the [Google Stackdriver Buildpack][bp/google-stackdriver]

APM integration are enabled with [bindings][bindings]. If a binding of the correct `type` is provided at build-time the corresponding java agent will be contributed to the application image. Connection credentials will be read from the binding at runtime. 

**Example**: Connecting to Azure Application Insights

The following command builds an image with the Azure Application Insights Java Agent
{{< code/copyable >}}
pack build samples/java --volume "$(pwd)/java/application-insights/binding:/platform/bindings/application-insights"
{{< /code/copyable >}}

To connect to Azure Applicaiton Insights at runtime a valid [Instrumentation Key][azure application insights instrumentation key] is required.
{{< code/copyable >}}
echo "<Instrumentation Key>" > java/application-insights/binding/InstrumentationKey
docker run --rm --tty \
  --env SERVICE_BINDING_ROOT=/bindings \
  --volume "$(pwd)/java/application-insights/binding:/bindings/app-insights" \
  samples/java
{{< /code/copyable >}}

## Debugging

If `BP_DEBUG_ENABLED` is set at build-time and `BPL_DEBUG_ENABLED` is set at runtime the [Debug Buildpack][bp/debug] will configure the application to accept debugger connections. The debug port defaults to `8000` and can be configured with `BPL_DEBUG_PORT` at runtime. If `BPL_DEBUG_SUSPEND` is set at runtime, the JVM will suspend execution until a debugger has attached.

**Example**: Remote Debugging

The following commands builds a debug-enabled image.
{{< code/copyable >}}
pack build samples/java \
  --path java/jar \
  --env BP_DEBUG_ENABLED=true
{{< /code/copyable >}}

To run the image with the debug port published:
{{< code/copyable >}}
docker run --env BPL_DEBUG_ENABLED=true --publish 8000:8000 samples/java
{{< /code/copyable >}}

Connect your IDE debugger to connect to the published port.

## Enabling JMX

If `BP_JMX_ENABLED` is set at build-time and `BPL_JMX_ENABLED` is set at runtime, the [JMX Buildpack][bp/jmx] will enable [JMX][jmx]. The JMX connector will listen on port `5000` by default. The port can be configured with the `BPL_JMX_PORT` environment variable at runtime.

**Example**: Enabling JMX

The following commands builds a JMX enabled image.
{{< code/copyable >}}
pack build samples/java \
  --path java/jar \
  --env BP_JMX_ENABLED=true
{{< /code/copyable >}}

To run the image with the JMX port published:
{{< code/copyable >}}
docker run --env BPL_JMX_ENABLED=true --publish 5000:5000 samples/java
{{< /code/copyable >}}

Connect [JConsole][jconsole] to the published port.
![JConsole](/images/jconsole.png)

## Selecting a Process

The Java buildpack will contribute a default process type that starts the application.

**Example**: Running the default process

Execute the following commands to start the default process type using a `samples/java` image built from any previous example command.
{{< code/copyable >}}
docker run  --rm --publish 8080:8080 samples/java
curl -s http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
{{< /code/copyable >}}

### Providing Additional Arguments

Additional arguments can be provided to the application using the container [`CMD`][oci config]. In Kubernetes set `CMD` using the `args` field on the [container][kubernetes container resource] resource.

**Example**: Setting the Server Port

Execute the following command passes an additional argument to application start command, setting the port to `8081`.
{{< code/copyable >}}
docker run --rm --publish 8081:8081 samples/java --server.port=8081
curl -s http://localhost:8081/actuator/health
{{< /code/copyable >}}

### Executing a Custom Command

To override the buildpack-provided start command with a custom command, set the container [`ENTRYPOINT`][oci config]

**Example**: Starting an Interactive Shell

The following command runs Bash interactively:
{{< code/copyable >}}
docker run --rm --entrypoint bash samples/java
{{< /code/copyable >}}

### Executing a Custom Command in the Buildpack-Provided Environment

Every buildpack-generated image contains an executable called the `launcher` which can be used to execute a custom command in an environment containing buildpack-provided environment variables. The `launcher` will execute any buildpack provided profile scripts before running to provided command, in order to set environment variables with values that should be calculated dynamically at runtime.

To run a custom start command in the buildpack-provided environment set the `ENTRYPOINT` to `launcher` and provide the command using the container `CMD`.

**Example**: Inspecting the Buildpack-Provided `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`
The following command will print value of `$JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` set by the buildpack:
{{< code/copyable >}}
docker run --rm --entrypoint launcher samples/java echo 'JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS: $JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS'
{{< /code/copyable >}}

Each argument provided to the launcher will be evaluated by the shell prior to execution and the original tokenization will be preserved. Note that, in the example above `'JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS: $JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS'` is single quoted so that `$JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` is evaluated in the container, rather than by the host shell.
