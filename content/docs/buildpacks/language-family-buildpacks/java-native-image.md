# Java Native Image Buildpack
The [Paketo Java Native Image Buildpack][bp/java-native-image] allows users to create an image containing a [GraalVM][graalvm] [native image][graalvm native image] application.

The Java Native Buildpack is a [composite buildpack][composite buildpack] and each step in a build is handled by one of it's [components](#components). The following docs describe common build configurations. For a full set of configuration options and capabilities see the homepages of the component buildpacks.
  
{{< table_of_contents >}}

## About the Examples
All Java Native Image Buildpack examples will use the Paketo [sample applications][samples].

Examples assume that the root of this repository is the working directory:
{{< code/copyable >}}
git clone https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/samples
cd samples
{{< /code/copyable >}}

The [pack CLI][pack] is used throughout the examples. `pack` is just one of several Cloud Native Buildpack [platforms][platforms] than can execute builds with the Java Native Image Buildpacks. For example, Spring Boot developers may want to explore the [Spring Boot Maven Plugin][spring boot maven plugin] or [Spring Boot Gradle Plugin][spring boot gradle plugin].

Examples assume that either the [Paketo Tiny][tiny builder] or [Paketo Base builder][base builder] is the default builder:
{{< code/copyable >}}
pack set-default-builder paketobuildpacks/builder:tiny
{{< /code/copyable >}}

All java native image example images should return `{"status":"UP"}` from the [actuator health endpoint][spring boot actuator endpoints].
{{< code/copyable >}}
docker run --rm --tty --publish 8080:8080 samples/java-native
curl -s http://localhost:8080/actuator/health | jq .
{{< /code/copyable >}}

## Supported Applications
The Java Native Image Buildpack currently only supports Spring Boot applications.

For all native image builds, it is required that:
* `BP_BOOT_NATIVE_IMAGE` is set at build time.
* The application declares a dependency on [Spring Native][spring native].


The version of [Spring Native][spring native] declared by the application may require a specific version of Spring Boot. See the Spring Native [release notes][spring native releases] for supported Spring Boot versions.

## Building From Source
The Java Native Image Buildpack supports the same [build tools and configuration options][java/building from source] as the [Java Buildpack][bp/java]. The build must produce an [executable jar][executable jar].

After compiling and packaging, the buildpack will replace provided application source code with the exploded JAR and proceed as described in [Building from an Executable Jar](#building-from-an-executable-jar).

**Example**: Building a Native image with Maven

The following command creates an image from source with `maven`.

{{< code/copyable >}}
pack build samples/java-native \
  --env BP_BOOT_NATIVE_IMAGE=true
  --path java/native-image
{{< /code/copyable >}}

## Building from an Executable JAR
An application developer may build an image from an exploded [executable JAR][executable jar]. Most platforms will automatically extract provided archives.

**Example**: Building a Native image from an Executable JAR

The following command uses Maven directly to compile an executable JAR and then uses the `pack` CLI to build an image from the JAR.

{{< code/copyable >}}
cd samples/java/native-image
./mvnw package
pack build samples/java-native \
  --env BP_BOOT_NATIVE_IMAGE=true
  --path java/native-image/target/demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
{{< /code/copyable >}}

The resulting application image will be identical to that built in the "Building a Native image with Maven" example.

## About the Native Image

The [GraalVM Buildpack][bp/graalvm] will provide the [GraalVM][graalvm] JDK, including the `native-image` utility (the [Native image builder][graalvm native image]), and the [Substrate VM][graalvm substrate vm].

The [Spring Boot Native Image Buildpack][bp/spring-boot-native-image] uses `native-image` to compile the Java bytecode into a standalone executable. The Spring Boot Native Image Buildpack relies on [Spring Native][spring native], a [GraalVM Feature][graalvm feature], to configure the native image build. The application must include Spring Native as a dependency; if it does not the build will fail.

**Note**: The `native-image` build is a memory intensive process and may be slow if insufficient memory is provided. From the [prerequisites][spring native prerequisites] in the Spring Native reference docs:


> "On Mac and Windows, it is recommended to increase the memory allocated to Docker to at least 8G (and potentially to add more CPUs as well) since native-image compiler is a heavy process. See this [Stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44533319/how-to-assign-more-memory-to-docker-container/44533437#44533437) for more details. On Linux, Docker uses by default the resources available on the host so no configuration is needed."

### Inspecting the JVM Version
The exact substrate VM version that was contributed to a given image can be read from the Bill-of-Materials.

**Example** Inspecting the JRE Version

Given an image named `samples/java-native` built from one of examples above, the following command will print the exact version of the installed substrate VM.
{{< code/copyable >}}
pack inspect-image samples/java-native --bom | jq '.local[] | select(.name=="native-image-svm") | .metadata.version'
{{< /code/copyable >}}

### Configuring the JVM Version
The following environment variable configures the JVM version at build-time.
* `BP_JVM_VERSION`
    * Defaults to the latest LTS version at the time of release.
    * Configures a specific JVM version.
    * *Example*: Given `BP_JVM_VERSION=8` or `BP_JVM_VERSION=8.*` the buildpack will install the latest patch releases of the Java 8 JDK and JRE.


## Spring Boot Applications
The Java Native Image Buildpack contains the [Spring Boot Buildpack][bp/spring-boot] and provides the same Spring Boot [features][java/spring boot applications] as the Java Buildpack.

## Selecting a Process

The Java Native Image Buildpack will contribute a default process type that starts the application.

**Example**: Running the Default Process

Execute the following commands to start the default process type using a `samples/java-native` image built from any previous example command.
{{< code/copyable >}}
docker run  --rm --publish 8080:8080 samples/java-native
curl -s http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
{{< /code/copyable >}}

### Providing Additional Arguments

Additional arguments can be provided to the application using the container [`CMD`][oci config]. In Kubernetes set `CMD` using the `args` field on the [container][kubernetes container resource] resource.

**Example**: Setting the Server Port

Execute the following command passes an additional argument to application start command, setting the port to `8081`.
{{< code/copyable >}}
docker run --rm --publish 8081:8081 samples/java-native --server.port=8081
curl -s http://localhost:8081/actuator/health
{{< /code/copyable >}}
