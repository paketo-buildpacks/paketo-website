This section gets you started with Paketo Buildpacks using Paketo **Builders**, the **Pack** CLI, and **Docker**.

Let's use the `base` Paketo Builder and the **Pack** CLI to build a Node.js app
as a runnable container image. App source code is available
[here](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/samples/tree/main/demo-apps/app-source).

**Prerequisites** - Install Pack and Docker
Follow [these instructions](https://buildpacks.io/docs/install-pack/) to get all set up.

And we're good to go! Let's build our app into a container image using the `pack build` command.

git clone https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/samples
cd samples/demo-apps/app-source
pack build paketo-demo-app --builder paketobuildpacks/builder:base

Successfully built image paketo-demo-app
{{< /code/output >}}

We've successfully created an image called **paketo-demo-app**. Now let's run our app image and validate that everything is working.

{{< code/copyable >}}
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -e PORT=8080 paketo-demo-app
{{< /code/copyable >}}

Wait a few seconds for your app to start.

{{< code/copyable >}}
curl http://localhost:8080/greeting
{{< /code/copyable >}}

{{< code/output >}}
Hello from your application image
{{< /code/output >}}

Awesome! Our app is now running on `localhost:8080`.
