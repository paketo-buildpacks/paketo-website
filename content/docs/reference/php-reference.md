## Supported Dependencies

The Paketo PHP Buildpack supports several versions of PHP and Composer.
For more details on the specific versions supported in a given buildpack
version, see the [release notes][bp/php-releases].

## Behavior
The Paketo PHP Buildpack is a [composite buildpack][paketo/composite-buildpack]
designed to build applications written in PHP.

### Package Management

With the PHP CNB, the only option for package management is
[Composer][external/composer].

The [Composer buildpack][bp/composer] will install `composer` as the package manager, and if a PHP
application contains a `composer.json` (and preferably a `composer.lock` file) packages
are installed by running `composer install` by the Composer Install
[buildpack][bp/composer-install]. Packages installed will be available in a
`vendor` directory in the application source directory, and will be cached for
rebuilds.

### Running With Webservers
The buildpacks within the PHP CNB will configure basic configuration for
working with FPM, HTTPD, Nginx, or the built-in PHP webserver. Web server
choice is set by the user via environment variable (see [PHP How To
documentation]({{< ref "docs/howto/php" >}})), and user-provided configurations will be considered as outlined
below.

##  Software Bill of Materials
The PHP buildpack supports the full [software bill of materials]({{< ref
"docs/concepts/sbom" >}}) (SBOM) in [Syft][format/syft],
[CycloneDX][format/cyclonedx], [SPDX][format/spdx], and
[Paketo-specific][format/paketo] formats.

Apps built with the buildpack that use Composer as a package manager contain
SBOM entries that provide a full picture of the packages installed in the final app image. There are also entries for the installed versions of PHP and Composer. Check out the [Access the Software Bill of Materials
guide]({{< ref "docs/howto/sbom" >}}) for more information about how to
retrieve the SBOM for your app image.


## Buildpack Configurations

The buildpacks in the PHP language family set default configurations, as well
as include configurations from user-provided sources. The sections below
outline the various configurations the buildpacks provide during the build process, and
the various locations that will also be considered as configuration sources.

### [PHP Distribution Buildpack][bp/php-dist] Configuration
This section lists the various configuration sources for PHP `.ini` files that
are made available to PHP at run-time.
1. The [default PHP `ini` file][bp/php-dist-ini] found from the PHP
   Distribution itself, with no modifications. It can be found on the container
   inside the PHP Distribution Buildpack layer under `/etc/php.ini`.
2. [Buildpack-specific configuration][bp/php-cnb-ini] which can be found inside the PHP
   Distribution Buildpack layer under `/etc/buildpack.ini`. This includes
   confgurations specific to the buildpack's install process and app image file
   system, such as the path to PHP extensions (`extension_dir`), the include
   path to the PHP library directory.
3. User-provided configurations from the `<APP-ROOT>/.php.ini.d` directory.

Check out the [PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR documentation section]({{< ref
"docs/reference/php-reference#php_ini_scan_dir" >}}) for more information.

### [PHP FPM Buildpack][bp/fpm] Configuration
Configuration for PHP FPM comes from a few sources, listed here in order of precedence from highest to lowest:

1. User-provided configurations located in `<APP-ROOT>/.php.fpm.d/*.conf`.
2. Configuration set by other buildpacks (such as the PHP Nginx
   Buildpack [FPM configuration][bp/nginx-fpm]), which is stored in 
   `/workspace/.php.fpm.bp/*.conf` files.
3. [Buildpack-specific configuration][bp/php-cnb-fpm], which includes
   configurations specific to the buildpack's role in the build process. This
   includes settings such as the default `listen` directive, and other features
   to make FPM work well with web servers.
4. The [default PHP FPM configuration][bp/php-dist-fpm] that is distributed alongside the PHP
   Distribution itself. This is stored at `$PHPRC/php-fpm.d/www.conf.default` in the container.


### [PHP Nginx Buildpack][bp/php-nginx] Configuration
The PHP Nginx Buildpack sets up two flavours of configuration itself, and
allows for a third flavour from users. They are listed here in order of highest
precedence, to lowest.

1. User-provided configuration files located in
   `<APP-ROOT>/.nginx.conf.d/*-server.conf` and
   `<APP-ROOT>/.nginx.conf.d/*-http.conf`.
2. [Basic Nginx configuration][bp/nginx-conf] is the `nginx.conf` file for
   running with PHP apps. See [PHP How To documentation]({{< ref
   "docs/howto/php" >}}) for settings that can be configured via environment
   variables.
3. Nginx-specific FPM settings (see FPM section above) is added to work with
   FPM.

### [PHP HTTPD Buildpack][bp/php-httpd] Configuration
1. [Basic HTTPD configuration][bp/httpd-conf] is the `httpd.conf` file for
   running with PHP apps. See [PHP How To documentation]({{< ref
   "docs/howto/php#provide-httpd-specific-configuration" >}}) for settings that
   can be configured via environment variables.
2. User-provided configuration files located in
   `<APP-ROOT>/.httpd.conf.d/*.conf`.

### [Composer Install Buildpack][bp/composer-install] Configuration
The Composer Install Buildpack sets up configuration to be used for running
`composer` commands. They are listed here in no specific order.

1. A Composer PHP `.ini` file is created for usage during the buildpack build
   process **only**. It will tell Composer where to find extensions when running
   `composer-install`.
2. Platform requirement `.ini` file available on the final image under
   `/workspace/.php.ini.d/composer-extensions.ini` which will be appended onto
   the `PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR`. It wil include any `composer.json` specified
   extensions that come from running the Composer `check-platform-reqs`
   command.

## Buildpack-Set Environment Variables
