The [Paketo Java Native Image Buildpack][bp/java-native-image] allows users to create an image containing a [GraalVM][graalvm] [native image][graalvm native image] application. The Java Native Image Buildpack supports the same [build tools and configuration options][java/building from source] as the [Java Buildpack][bp/java]. The build must produce an [executable jar][executable jar].

## Supported Applications

For all native image builds, it is required that:

* `BP_NATIVE_IMAGE` is set at build time.

For Spring Boot applications, it is required that:

* The application declares a dependency on [Spring Native][spring native].
* The version of [Spring Native][spring native] declared by the application may require a specific version of Spring Boot. See the Spring Native [release notes][spring native releases] for supported Spring Boot versions.

## Components

The following component buildpacks compose the Paketo Java Native Image Buildpack.
