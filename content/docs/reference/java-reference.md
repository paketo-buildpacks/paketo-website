The [Paketo Java Buildpack][bp/java] allows users to create an image containing a JVM application from a precompiled artifact or directly from source.

The Java Buildpack is a [composite buildpack][composite buildpack] and each step in a build is handled by one of its [components](#components). For a full set of configuration options and capabilities see the homepages for the component buildpacks.

## About the JVM

The Java Buildpack uses the [BellSoft Liberica][liberica] implementations of the JRE and JDK. JVM installation is handled by the [BellSoft Liberica Buildpack][bp/bellsoft-liberica]. The JDK will be installed in the build container but only the JRE will be contributed to the application image.

See the [homepage][bp/bellsoft-liberica] for the Bellsoft Liberica Buildpack for a full set of configuration options.

## Memory Calculator

The Java Buildpack installs a component called the Memory Calculator which will configure JVM memory based on the resources available to the container at runtime. The calculated flags will be appended to `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`.

## Spring Boot Applications

If the application uses Spring Boot the [Spring Boot Buildpack][bp/spring-boot] will enhance the resulting image by adding additional metadata to the image config,
applying Boot-specific performance optimizations, and enabling runtime auto-configuration.

### Additional Metadata

The Spring Boot Buildpack adds the following additional image labels:

* `org.opencontainers.image.title` - set to the value of `Implementation-Title` from  `MANIFEST.MF`.
* `org.opencontainers.image.version` - set to the values of `Implementation-Version` from `MANIFEST.MF`.
* `org.springframework.boot.version` - set to the value of `Spring-Boot-Version` from `MANIFEST.MF`.
* `org.springframework.cloud.dataflow.spring-configuration-metadata.json` - containing [configuration metadata][spring boot configuration metadata].
* `org.springframework.cloud.dataflow.spring-configuration-metadata.json` - containing `dataflow-configuration-metadata.properties`, if present.

In addition, the buildpack will add an entry with name `dependencies` to the Bill-of-Materials listing the application dependencies.

### Optimizations

The Spring Boot Buildpack can apply domain-specific knowledge to optimize the performance of Spring Boot applications. For example, if the buildpack detects that the application is a reactive web application the thread count will be reduced to `50` from a default of `250`.

## Components

The following component buildpacks compose the Java Buildpack. Buildpacks are listed in the order they are executed.
