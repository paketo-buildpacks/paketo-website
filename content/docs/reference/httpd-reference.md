The HTTPD Paketo Buildpack supports the installation of the
Apache HTTP Server binary distribution
onto the `$PATH` inside a container. This makes it available to subsequent
buildpacks.

## Supported Dependencies

The HTTPD Paketo Buildpack supports several versions of Apache HTTP Server.
For more details on the specific versions supported in a given buildpack
version, see the [release
notes](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/httpd/releases).

## Behavior
When the HTTPD Buildpack participates in a build, it will contribute in one of two ways:

1. When an `httpd.conf` file **is present** in your app's source code, the
   buildpack will set up an Apache HTTP server with that config.

1. When the `httpd.conf` **is not present** in the app's source code, the
   buildpack simply provides the Apache HTTP Server dependency to subsequent
   buildpacks without actually setting up a server.
