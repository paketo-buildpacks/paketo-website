# Contributing to Paketo Buildpacks

Welcome! We're glad you have an interest in improving Paketo Buildpacks.
Check out our [Contribution
Guide](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for an idea of where to begin. We also have a collection of [good first
issues](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Apaketo-buildpacks+org%3Apaketo-community+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+state%3Aopen&type=Issues)
on our repositories if you're eager to start contributing.

### RFCs

If you'd like to learn more about the buildpacks' architecture and the design
decisions being made, it may be helpful to read through some of our
[past](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/rfcs) and
[present](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/rfcs/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen)
RFCs. Some language family buildpack repositories (e.g.
[Node.js](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/nodejs/tree/main/rfcs)) also
contain language-specific RFCs that may provide helpful context.
[Here](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Apaketo-buildpacks+label%3Arfc&state=open&type=Issues)
you'll find a list of all open language-specific RFCs within the Paketo
project.
