      <description>If the entire Cloud Native Buildpack experience is new to you, you may want to stop and take some time to read about authoring a Cloud Native Buildpack (CNB). Packit is a Go library that is an abstraction that conforms to the CNB specification that takes a minimal approach in terms of the features that are implemented giving a lot of fine control to the buildpack author.
This tutorial&amp;rsquo;s goal is to take you from nothing to a buildpack that puts a dependency on the filesystem as fast as possible, so with that let&amp;rsquo;s get started!</description>

      <guid>https://paketo.io/docs/howto/sbom/</guid>
      <description>This documentation explains how to access the software bill of materials (SBOM) for an app image built using Paketo buildpacks. For more in-depth field definitions and details check out the software bill of materials concept page.
Access the Software Bill of Materials on a Sample Application  A buildpack can generate SBOMs in different formats. The primary supported SBOMs are in Syft, SPDX, and CycloneDX JSON formats. Paketo buildpacks also generate an SBOM in a Paketo-specific schema, but this SBOM is deprecated.</description>

      <guid>https://paketo.io/docs/howto/create-custom-stack/</guid>
      <description>Preface  This documentation explains how to create a custom stack based off of the existing Paketo stacks. Check out the stacks concept page for more information about what a stack is and the Paketo offerings.
It&amp;rsquo;s recommended to use an existent Paketo stack offering, over creating a custom stack in order to leverage the full range of Paketo security patching and compliance standards.
In some cases, a custom stack image may be useful for users who may need an extra system library or user ID, for example.</description>

      <description>In the Getting Started tutorial, you ran a pack build command to build a sample app. This resulted in some output similar to this block:
... ===&amp;gt; DETECTING paketo-buildpacks/node-engine 0.1.1 paketo-buildpacks/npm-install 0.2.0 paketo-buildpacks/npm-start 0.0.2 ... ===&amp;gt; BUILDING Paketo Node Engine Buildpack 0.1.1 ... Paketo NPM Install Buildpack 0.2.0 ... Paketo NPM Start Buildpack 0.0.2 ... In this section, we will make sense of this output and explain how the buildpacks detect what dependencies are needed by your app to build it into a runnable app image.</description>

      <description>In the Getting Started tutorial, you used the pack CLI and the base builder to create a runnable image with your application. This section explains what builders are and what builders are released by the Paketo project.
What is a builder?  A builder is an image that contains three components:
 a set of buildpacks, which provide your app&amp;rsquo;s dependencies a stack, which provides the OS layer for your app image the CNB lifecycle, which puts everything together to produce your final app image  For more information about builders, see buildpacks.</description>

      <guid>https://paketo.io/docs/concepts/stacks/</guid>
      <description>In the Getting Started tutorial, you used the Paketo builder to build a Node.js app. One of the core pieces to Buildpacks and Builders are Stack Images. Stacks provide the buildpack lifecycle with build-time and run-time environments in the form of images.
What is a stack?  A stack consists of two images:
 build image: the environment in which your app is built run image: the OS layer for your app image  For more information about stacks, see buildpacks.</description>

      <description>In the Getting Started tutorial, you used the Paketo builder to build a Node.js app. Once you have an app image, you can access metadata about all of the dependencies present in the final app image using the software bill of materials.
What is the software bill of materials?  A software bill of materials (SBOM) is an industry standard mechanism of surfacing metadata about dependencies in images or applications. The metadata consists of various fields such as:</description>
