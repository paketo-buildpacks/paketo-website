      <description>If the entire Cloud Native Buildpack experience is new to you, you may want to stop and take some time to read about authoring a a Cloud Native Buildpack (CNB). Packit is a Go library that is an abstraction that conforms to the CNB specification that takes a minimal approach in terms of the features that are implemented giving a lot of fine control to the buildpack author.
This tutorial&amp;rsquo;s goal is to take you from nothing to a buildpack that puts a dependency on the filesystem as fast as possible, so with that let&amp;rsquo;s get started!</description>

      <description>In the Getting Started tutorial, you ran a pack build command to build a sample app. This resulted in some output similar to this block:
... ===&amp;gt; DETECTING paketo-buildpacks/node-engine 0.1.1 paketo-buildpacks/npm-install 0.2.0 paketo-buildpacks/npm-start 0.0.2 ... ===&amp;gt; BUILDING Paketo Node Engine Buildpack 0.1.1 ... Paketo NPM Install Buildpack 0.2.0 ... Paketo NPM Start Buildpack 0.0.2 ... In this section, we will make sense of this output and explain how the buildpacks detect what dependencies are needed by your app to build it into a runnable app image.</description>

      <title>Builders</title>

      <description>In the Getting Started tutorial, you used the pack CLI and the base builder to create a runnable image with your application. This section explains what builders are and what builders are released by the Paketo project.
What is a builder?  A builder is an image that contains three components:
 a set of buildpacks, which provide your app&amp;rsquo;s dependencies a stack, which provides the OS layer for your app image the CNB lifecycle, which puts everything together to produce your final app image  For more information about builders, see buildpacks.</description>

      <guid>https://paketo.io/docs/concepts/stacks/</guid>
      <description>In the Getting Started tutorial, you used the Paketo builder to build a Node.js app. One of the core pieces to Buildpacks and Builders are Stack Images. Stacks provide the buildpack lifecycle with build-time and run-time environments in the form of images.
What is a stack?  A stack consists of two images:
 build image: the environment in which your app is built run image: the OS layer for your app image  For more information about stacks, see buildpacks.</description>

      <description>In the Getting Started tutorial, you used the Paketo builder to build a Node.js app. Once you have an app image, you can access metadata about all of the dependencies present in the final app image using the bill of materials.
What is the bill of materials?  A bill of materials (BOM) is an industry standard mechanism of surfacing metadata about dependencies in images or applications. The metadata consists of various fields such as:</description>
